# 3-1-1 mini app with [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) machine learning model on [Render](https://render.com)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-1-1
Inspired by the necessity of citizens providing the type of problem or having public sector internal teams offloading tasks, I have built this model to understand machine learning applied to vision.

# Total effort:
fast.ai lesson1 and 2 (~4hours)
Data access, manipulation and preparation (~4hours)
Training (~4hours)
Deploying (~30min)

In less than 24 hours (3 work days) it is possible to deploy a model for visual classification with 89% accuracy.
